## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Jetpack Compose - Android's modern toolkit for building native UI.
- [Splash Screen](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen) - SplashScreen API lets apps launch with animation, including an into-app motion at launch, a splash screen showing your app icon, and a transition to your app itself.  
- ViewModel - State Holder. Responsible for the production of UI state, contains the necessary logic for that task.
- Lifecycle - Lifecycle-aware components.
- [Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) - The Navigation component provides support for Jetpack Compose applications. You can navigate between composables while taking advantage of the Navigation componentâ€™s infrastructure and features.
- [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/work) - The WorkManager API makes it easy to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that must be run reliably.
- Room - Database.
- Kotlin Coroutines - A concurrency design pattern to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
- Kotlin Flows - In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value. For example, you can use a flow to receive live updates from a database.
- [Dagger-Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/gradle-setup) - Dependency injection.
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- [Retrofit2 & Moshi](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - REST API consumption.
